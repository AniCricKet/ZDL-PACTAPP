## Description

The Carbon Emissions Calculator is a web application designed to help users estimate their carbon emissions and the potential impact on global temperature based on various factors such as miles driven per month, car type, air travel miles, and home energy consumption. This tool provides a convenient way to track and visualize the environmental impact of various lifestyle choices and decisions.

## Features

- Calculate carbon emissions based on input data.
- Estimate the impact on global temperature due to carbon emissions.
- Visualize changes in temperature and carbon emissions over time using charts.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data**: Fill in the following information in the form:
   - Miles driven per month
   - Car type (Select from Small, Medium, Large, or Hybrid)
   - Air travel miles
   - Home energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh)

2. **Click Calculate**: After entering the required data, click the "Calculate" button to obtain the carbon emissions and temperature change estimates.

3. **View Results**: The results section will display the calculated carbon emissions and their potential impact on global temperature.

4. **Visualize Data**: The charts below the results show the historical data for temperature change and carbon emissions. These charts provide a visual representation of how your choices affect the environment over time.

## Dependencies

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): Used for creating interactive and informative line charts.

## How to Install

This is a client-side web application, so there is no specific installation required. You can run it by opening the HTML file in a web browser. Make sure you have an active internet connection to load the Chart.js library from the Content Delivery Network (CDN).
